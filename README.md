# nx

From Latin nexus (“the act of binding together; bond”), from nectō (“bind”). 

nx, is short for nexus - it binds together a website for you as static files.
It's a static site generator with hot reloading done using few dependencies to
keep the tool stable.

## Install locally

Inside the repo:  
`npm install -g`

`yarn add global $PWD`

## Updating metadata mechanism by users

**N.B this mechanism is not complete, it's the next feature I'd like to add to
the project**

In order to provide a CMS like experience I'd like to use a global json file to
update things & maybe provide some way to link static files e.g images.
